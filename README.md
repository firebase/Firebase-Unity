# firebase-unity
Today, I have both bad news and good news to report.

First the bad news.  This public github repository will no longer be supported or updated.  We are shutting this down today and will soon delete all content.

Now the good news.  We are deleting this repo because Unity is becoming an officially supported platform in Firebase and has gone into public Beta!  Check out the documentation [at our official firebase site](https://firebase.google.com/docs/unity/setup/) and watch our presentations at the [Firebase Dev Summit](https://events.withgoogle.com/firebase-dev-summit/).
